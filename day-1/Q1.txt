Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

Both are used to establish the connection between client and server.


HTTP1.1:

    TCP connection required for each request and response.
    It does not allows the next request to be sent until the previous response complete.
    It takes more time to complete the all the request to render the content in browser.
    Performance wise its poor.
    It sends the request in text format.
    It does not send the multiple requests at a time.


HTTP2:

    It allows multiple request and response at a time in parallel using single TCP connection.
    It reduces the execution time.
    Better Performance compared to HTTP1.
    All the requests and responses are in binary format.
    It encodes the request and response into smaller units.
    It supports multiplexing.
